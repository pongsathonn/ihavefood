TODO  design error event when critical error occur then rollback every services place order logic 
     such as when application logic error , that service should publish "order.cancel.event" which error message
     and every servcis should subscribe to this routingkey, but if error doesn't affect application logic then
     it should be handle for each service
     example critical error that should be published with "order.cancel.event"
     - validation place order failed, retrive order information
     - calculate delivery fee failed , becasue it might be impact company lose revenue which is big trouble
     
     example not count as critical error 
     - Client query user profile from user service , because it's not relate to order food logic

TODO (DONE) handle rabbitmq consistant every services 
TODO (DONE) add log for getEnv every services
TODO (DONE) UserService refactor code , create more data layer for repository
TODO (DONE) auth , tested assign role in middleware ( rold invalid ) correct (maybe)
TODO (DONE) add role in claims (JWT)
TODO (DONE)  might modify some setupMux middleware for role
TODO (DONE) add Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    FLOW my app contains 3 roles "visitor" | "user" | "admin"
    - visitor can access register endpoint we treat this as "visitor"
    - new user registerd (default role "user")
    - rootuser create when app start has privilage to give user role "admin" | "user"
    - admin role can access restrict api such as "DELETE /api/users/foobar"
    - optional = add permission to role i.e admin role can "read" | "write" , user role can only "read"
TODO (DONE) modify userService , authservice follow food.proto
TODO (DONE) change dockerfile cmd from "docker-auth" to somethingelse
TODO (DONE) might remove pb from user service ( repository should be single response not incluse protobuff ) 
TODO (DONE) implement Basic auth in authservice  (already added in swagger)
TODO (DONE) userservice implementing all methods and add method to swagger
TODO (DONE)coupon service implement everyfuncion and add check coupon in placeorder ( gateway ) 
TODO (CHECKED) [IMPORTANT]!! validate protobuff enum in Go , change from use map to other way , in swagger doc too
TODO (DONE) make cron job for couponservice to delete expired coupon
TODO (DONE) validate duplciated palce order still process not done yet
TODO (DONE) fn calculate delivery fee in delivery services
TODO (DONE)might delet getEnv() function becasue i hard code default value
TODO (DONE for authService) for full validate
    - length validate etc.username should be 8-16
    - format validate email (regex)  etc. should be xxx@mail.com
    - character validate (regex)  etc. password only contians letter and nubmer
    - password strength etc. password should contains one special, mix uppercase and lowercase
    - uniqueness etc. username already created, email duplicated
TODO (DONE) check format email and phonenumber (userservice,orderservice ) and other service has email check in .proto
TODO (DONE) change log to slog
TODO (DONE) remove redundant error
TODO (DONE) use id for get post put update delete blabla
TODO (OK)improve documents in services ( in .proto i think it quit okay)

TODO write simple healthcheck 
TODO test fucntion and modify openapi
TODO unittest in deliveryservice

TODO document everything that export , NO i won't do this. lazy

TODO ensure event table is valid
TODO curl test every endpoints ( look at food.proto )
TODO write UML correctly

TODO [WHEN DEPLOY] modify this options in grpc-gateway becasue it use for development rightnow 
     grpc.WithTransportCredentials(insecure.NewCredentials()),
TODO [WHEN DEPLOY] handle environment variable in compose file and each service 
TODO [WHEN DEPLOY] use TLS credentials for grpc ( typically use opts with insecure which is bad for production )

# DEPLOY 
- Use CloudFlare ?

TODO [IMPORTANT] jwt token need to match with username in middleware (right now i can just change username in place order request 
     but only login jwt can use every where which is false )

TODO recheck everyline of code for consistant, espeacially error handling
TODO Deploy
TODO practice algorithm

TODO Find a Job !!!!!!!!!!!!


# OPTIONAL 
TODO add Unittest (might not optional) 
TODO authservice might be suit with session transation
TODO when order is deleted or some data that need sync handle this
TODO adding json-schema validation mongo might benefits alot
TODO use interceptor for middleware in grpc server ( previously used http middleware which is quit bad )
TODO seperate grpc server , gateway with /cmd/gateway , /cmd/server
TODO add debug mode for compose (optional)
TODO multistage build
